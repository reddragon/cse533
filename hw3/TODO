We send an RREP followed by an RREQ. Check if this is in violation
with anything mentioned in the handout.

Read document to see where we need to perform hostname <-> IP Address
conversions.

Print out trace messages with VM names instead of IP addresses.

Do NOT propagate RREQ if we send an RREP unless this RREQ replaced an
existing path in our routing table.

"Unlike AODV, when an intermediate node receives a RREQ for which it
generates a RREP, it should nevertheless continue to flood the RREQ it
received if the RREQ pertains to a source node whose existence it has
heretofore been unaware of, or the RREQ gives it a more efficient
route than it knew of back to the source node (the reason for
continuing to flood the RREQ is so that other nodes in the intranet
also become aware of the existence of the source node or of the
potentially more optimal reverse route to it, and update their tables
accordingly)."
